    <p><strong>How/Why Did I Make The Map</strong></p>
    <p>I used <strong>Pandas</strong> to clean and merge the dataframes. Then I used <strong>Qgis</strong> to create a US state map based on the nature earth spatial data. Finally, I put it into <strong>Adobe illustrator</strong> to make it prettier. </p>
<p>I chose to map because the data showed a very obvious geographical pattern, with the southern states on average have higher uninsured rates. Readers can also identify the uninsured level of each state from the map.</p>

<p><b>2. An Interactive D3 Chart</b></p>
    <div id="chart-1"></div>
 <p><strong>How/Why Did I Make The Chart</strong></p>
<p>I used <b>D3.js</b> to make the chart. To make the chart interactive, I used <b>d3.tip</b>. When you hover over the circles, you can see the exact number the dot represents. 
<p>I chose the range plot because it is a very good way to show the difference in uninsured rates between men and women. Itâ€™s also easy to see how the gaps are different among states.</p>
