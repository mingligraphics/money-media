You'll want to use the [sawhorse command-line interface](https://github.com/littlecolumns/sawhorse-cli) to set up a new sawhorse project.

First you'll install sawhorse globally.

```
npm install -g sawhorse
```

That will install the `sawhorse` command, which you can then use to create a new project. The command below will create a new `my-project` folder with a sawhorse template project inside.

```
sawhorse create my-project
```
